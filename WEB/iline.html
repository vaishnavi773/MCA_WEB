		<p style= "color:blue">You can think of HTML development as providing the bones of a webpage,<br>
		while CSS provides the skin, and JavaScript provides the brains.<br>
		A webpage can contain headings, paragraphs, images, videos, and <br>
		many other types of data.Front-end developers use the HTML element to<br>
 		specify what kind of information each item <br>
		on a webpage contains — for instance, the “p” HTML element indicates a paragraph. Developers <br>
		also write HTML language code to specify how different items relate to <br>
		one another in the page’s overall structure or document structure.<br>
