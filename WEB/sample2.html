		<p>Parrots (Psittaciformes), also known as <i>psittacines</i> , are  birds with a  <br>
		X strong curved beak, upright stance, and clawed feet.[a] They are classified in  <br>
		four families that contain roughly 410 species in 101 genera,  <br>
		found mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. The four families are the Psittaculidae  <br>
		(Old World parrots), Psittacidae (African and New World parrots), Cacatuoidea (cockatoos), <br>
		and Strigopidae (New Zealand parrots). One-third of all parrot species are threatened by <br>
		extinction, with a higher aggregate extinction risk (IUCN Red List Index) than any other  <br>
		comparable bird group. Parrots have a generally pantropical distribution with several <br>
	 	species inhabiting temperate regions as well. The greatest diversity of parrots is in <br>
		South America and Australasia.</p>
